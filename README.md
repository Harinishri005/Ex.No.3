### DATE:17.9.2025                                                                       
### REGISTER NUMBER :212223090008
### Aim:
Prompt engineering plays a crucial role in shaping how large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT generate responses. The effectiveness of AI-driven communication often depends not only on the dataset but also on how questions or instructions are framed. In various real-world applications such as education, healthcare, business decision-making, and customer support, the way prompts are designed can determine the accuracy, clarity, and usefulness of the output.

This report provides a detailed exploration of **scenario-based report development** using four diverse prompting techniques:

1. Straightforward Prompts
2. Tabular Format Prompting
3. Missing Word Prompting
4. Preceding Question Prompting


## 1. Straightforward Prompts

### Definition

Straightforward prompts are the most direct and simple form of prompting. They involve clear, explicit instructions or questions without additional context, examples, or formatting. This technique relies on the AI’s understanding of the natural language request.

### Scenario

A **medical electronics student** preparing for a viva examination may need concise definitions of technical concepts. Instead of providing background, the student simply asks the AI for a definition.

### Example

* **Prompt**: *“Explain cloud computing in simple terms.”*
* **AI Response**: *“Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services such as storage, servers, databases, and software over the internet, allowing users to access resources on demand without owning physical hardware.”*


## 2. Tabular Format Prompting

### Definition

Tabular format prompting structures the AI’s response in a **table format**, making it easier to compare, analyze, or summarize information. This is particularly useful for decision-making scenarios.

### Scenario

A **business analyst** comparing different cloud service providers needs structured information to present to management. Instead of receiving text-heavy explanations, a table provides clarity and efficiency.

### Example

* **Prompt**: *“Compare AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud based on pricing, scalability, and global reach in a table format.”*

* **AI Response (Table):**

| Provider        | Pricing                     | Scalability                      | Global Reach                   |
| --------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| AWS             | Pay-as-you-go, wide range   | Highly scalable, advanced tools  | 200+ countries, broad coverage |
| Microsoft Azure | Competitive enterprise      | Strong integration with MS tools | 140+ countries, growing fast   |
| Google Cloud    | Flexible pricing, free tier | Good scalability with AI tools   | 100+ countries, strong in AI   |



## 3. Missing Word Prompting

### Definition

In missing word prompting, a sentence or phrase is deliberately left incomplete, requiring the AI to fill in the blank. This encourages creativity, contextual understanding, and predictive reasoning.

### Scenario

A **trainer in soft skills** may want students to guess the missing term in communication-related concepts. By framing prompts with missing words, both students and AI models are encouraged to reason contextually.

### Example

* **Prompt**: *“In project management, the process of breaking down tasks into smaller, manageable parts is called \_\_\_\_\_\_.”*
* **AI Response**: *“Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).”*

## 4. Preceding Question Prompting

### Definition

Preceding question prompting builds context by asking a prior or guiding question before the actual question. This helps the AI model focus and provide more relevant, context-aware answers.

### Scenario

A **university student** preparing a project report on artificial intelligence may structure their research by breaking down complex queries into smaller guiding questions before asking the main question.

### Example

* **Preceding Question**: *“What are the advantages of artificial intelligence in healthcare?”*

* **Main Question**: *“Considering these advantages, how can AI help in early disease detection?”*

* **AI Response**: *“Since AI provides faster data analysis, image recognition in medical scans, and predictive analytics, it can help in early disease detection by identifying patterns that humans may miss, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy.”*


## Comparative Analysis of Prompting Techniques

| Technique                    | Simplicity | Depth of Answer | Use Case Example           | Limitation              |
| ---------------------------- | ---------- | --------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Straightforward Prompts      | High       | Low to Medium   | Definitions, quick facts   | May lack context        |
| Tabular Prompting            | Medium     | Medium          | Comparisons, reports       | May oversimplify        |
| Missing Word Prompting       | Medium     | Medium          | Quizzes, knowledge tests   | Depends on clarity      |
| Preceding Question Prompting | Low        | High            | Research, detailed reports | Time-consuming to frame |



### Conclusion 
Prompt engineering plays a vital role in enhancing the effectiveness of AI responses by shaping the way questions are framed. Each technique serves a unique purpose, with straightforward prompts offering quick answers and tabular prompts providing clear comparisons. Missing word prompts encourage active learning and knowledge testing, while preceding question prompts ensure depth and contextual relevance. By applying the right prompting method to the right scenario, users can improve clarity, accuracy, and engagement in AI-driven communication. Thus, prompt engineering becomes a key tool for achieving meaningful and goal-oriented interactions with AI systems.


### Result: 
The various types of Prompts are executed successfully with generated the report.
